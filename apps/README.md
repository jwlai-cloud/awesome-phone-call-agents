# Apps

Use this directory for runnable phone-call workflow apps, including focused demo apps for MCP, CLI, scheduler, or host integration patterns.

Apps should directly help AI agents schedule, monitor, administer, or safely operate phone-call workflows. This includes focused integration apps for MCP, CLI, scheduler, and host patterns. They are not CALL-E SDKs or supported product APIs.

Use [`../plugins/`](../plugins/) for no-code and low-code workflow-platform nodes, actions, connectors, templates, or recipes.

Current apps:

| App | Language | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`typescript/verify-contact-claim`](typescript/verify-contact-claim/) | TypeScript | Contact-claim verifier for a suspicious voicemail, text or missed call: dials only the number printed on the customer's own card, asks whether that contact was genuine and returns the words that came back with a hash-chained record. |
| [`typescript/call-neuron`](typescript/call-neuron/) | TypeScript | Functional consent-first scholarship outreach prototype with manual/file intake, identity-first disclosure, neutral voicemail, one-recipient CALL-E planning and confirmation, live status, human dispositions, and browser-local campaign data. |
| [`typescript/phone-approval-gate`](typescript/phone-approval-gate/) | TypeScript | Phone-verified approval gate for irreversible automation, with a one-time spoken code, an escalation ladder, dual control and a verifiable approval record. |
| [`typescript/call-on-behalf`](typescript/call-on-behalf/) | TypeScript | Delegated errand caller with a disclosure budget: says only the details the person authorized, commits only inside authorized windows, and returns the answers plus the transcript. |
| [`python/hungrycall-cascade`](python/hungrycall-cascade/) | Python | Sequential call cascade that stops at the first candidate meeting every must and boundary, with staged concessions treated as an authorisation and unknown outcomes halting the run. |
| [`python/ringedingeding`](python/ringedingeding/) | Python | Multi-recipient response aggregator that keeps answered, refused and unreached apart, reports every share against those who answered, and never reads silence as consent. |
| [`python/rehab-adherence-caller`](python/rehab-adherence-caller/) | Python | Rehab course-adherence caller that decides from a patient's attendance trajectory whether to call and which call to make, keeps a volunteered symptom out of the automated path, and treats an unkept promise to return as its own outcome. |
| [`typescript/multi-party-scheduler`](typescript/multi-party-scheduler/) | TypeScript | Two-phase appointment scheduling over phone calls: gather availability, confirm one time with everybody by voice, release everybody who confirmed when the commit fails and resume an interrupted run. |
| [`python/callback-window-coordinator`](python/callback-window-coordinator/) | Python | Consent-first callback-window coordinator with masked preview, stable idempotency, and structured CALL-E results. |
| [`python/batch-runner`](python/batch-runner/) | Python | JSONL batch runner using CALL-E CLI auth state, FastMCP, Rich output, and MCP tool-call metadata. |
| [`python/broker-login-client`](python/broker-login-client/) | Python | CALL-E brokered login client with local token cache and MCP HTTP calls. |
| [`typescript/broker-login-client`](typescript/broker-login-client/) | TypeScript | CALL-E brokered login client using `@call-e/core`. |
| [`typescript/broker-login-client-standalone`](typescript/broker-login-client-standalone/) | TypeScript | CALL-E brokered login client without a shared package dependency. |
| [`python/oauth-login-client`](python/oauth-login-client/) | Python | CALL-E OAuth login client for MCP Streamable HTTP. |
| [`typescript/oauth-login-client`](typescript/oauth-login-client/) | TypeScript | CALL-E OAuth login client for MCP Streamable HTTP. |
| [`typescript/vibehub-founder-relay`](typescript/vibehub-founder-relay/) | TypeScript | Consent-first founder-match readiness call with masked preview, stable idempotency, and structured CALL-E results. |

Every app should include its own README with setup, usage, side effects, credential handling, dry-run or preview behavior, and cancellation or rollback instructions when it can create calls or recurring jobs.
