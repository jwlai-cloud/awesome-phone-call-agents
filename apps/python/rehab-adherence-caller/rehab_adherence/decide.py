"""The trajectory state machine and the contact gate.

This is the part of the application that is not a phone call. A missed session
is not an event to react to; it is one point on a course. The same missed
session produces a different action depending on what came before it, and on
what the previous call established.

Nothing here is clinical. The states describe *attendance behaviour* and the
actions describe *logistics*. Any clinical judgement stays with the clinician,
and a volunteered symptom always leaves this machine and goes to a human.
