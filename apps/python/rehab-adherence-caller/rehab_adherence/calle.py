"""CALL-E adapter.

The SDK is an optional dependency, installed with the `live` extra. A default
install cannot place a call, which is a structural guarantee rather than a
promise: `import calle` is not merely unused in the default path, it is absent.

Verified against `calle-ai==0.7.0` (signatures read from the installed package,
response shape from https://docs.heycall-e.com/api-reference/calls):

    client = CalleClient(api_key=..., base_url=...)
    created = client.calls.create(task=, recipients=, result_schema=, metadata=,
                                  idempotency_key=)
    completed = client.calls.wait_for_result(created["id"], timeout_seconds=,
                                             interval_seconds=)

The terminal payload nests the conversation three levels down:

    completed["recipients"][i]["attempts"][j]["transcript_turns"]
        -> [{"offset_seconds": 0, "speaker": "bot"|"user"|"unknown", "text": ...}]

`completion_confidence` is an object -- `{"score": 0.92, "label": "high"}` -- not
a bare float. `evidence` is a list of short strings from the post-call summary.
