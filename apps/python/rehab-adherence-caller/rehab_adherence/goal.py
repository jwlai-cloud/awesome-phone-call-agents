"""Build the call goal and the result schema.

Two safety properties are enforced here rather than documented and hoped for:

1. **The goal is assembled from a whitelist.** It is built from typed, validated,
   length-capped fields only. Arbitrary keys in the course file cannot reach the
   caller's mouth, because nothing in this module reads the raw document.
2. **The caller cannot ask a clinical question**, because the question set per
   action is fixed here and none of them assess anything. "What is stopping you
   attending" is logistics. "Is your pain worse" is assessment, and does not exist
   in this file.

The conversation itself is CALL-E's, and the model behind it is not selectable.
The only levers are this goal string and the result schema, so both are narrow on
purpose.
